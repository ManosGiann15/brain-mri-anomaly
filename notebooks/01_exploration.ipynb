    "### 4 Modaliries of MRI and the Tissue type they highlight\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  **Contrast MRI** : This is the most common and strongly used MRI, often suggested by doctors to diagnose a severe health disorder. In this MRI test, a gadolinium-based dye is injected intravenously into the patientâ€™s body prior to the examination. This dye helps radiologists generate clear and vibrant scans of multiple body organs. Some serious health conditions that compel doctors to recommend contrast MRI are - back problems, brain injury, infection, or even to detect tumors or cancers. The high-resolution pictures of internal structures help doctors determine the root cause and start the right treatment immediately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Functional MRI** : Functional MRI, also called fMRI, is performed to measure blood flow to the brain and check out the brain functions. Doctors recommend this MRI scan whenever a patient comes with a brain injury. The scan reports highlight the areas of the brain that are activated. This helps doctors determine whether the brain is fully functional or has a massive injury. Diseases like dementia, Alzheimer's, and brain tumors can be easily detected with this scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Cardiac MRI** : Doctors suggest a cardiac MRI when they come across patients suffering from heart disease or suspect problems in blood vessels or aorta. They recommend an immediate scan when patients encounter a heart attack. The scan report shows a detailed picture of the heart, blood vessels, and the overall circulatory system. By analyzing this report, doctors determine how the circulatory system is functioning and whether it requires any serious treatment. Moreover, the cardiac MRI process can immediately detect heart blockage, holes in the heart, heart tumors, and other serious heart issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Musculoskeletal MRI** : Doctors immediately recommend a musculoskeletal MRI for patients suffering from joint problems or bone injuries. This MRI process helps doctors diagnose bone-related issues like herniated disc, spinal fracture, spinal cord compression, etc. Even in case of a hairline fracture, doctors suggest getting an MRI. This is because X-rays are not that effective in detecting a slight structural change within a body. For example, a tear in ligament, cartilage, or tendons can be easily assessed with a musculoskeletal MRI.\n",
